# Chatterlayer

Live, colour-coded captions for your Discord voice call, rendered straight into
OBS.

Built for streamers who hang out in Discord calls and want viewers to know
**who said what** — including viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing, watching
muted at work, or on a connection that's chewing up your audio.

**Free, forever, for everyone.** No paid tiers, no licence keys, no accounts, no
API keys, no per-minute billing. The speech recognition runs on your own PC. After
the one-time model download, Chatterlayer never sends anyone's audio anywhere —
it doesn't even need an internet connection to caption.

## What it looks like

Each person in your call gets their own colour and their own caption line:

```
▌ Ruptz    so if we push through the gate now
▌ Maya     no no no wait for the timer
▌ Dev      i already went in
```

- Everyone's audio is transcribed **separately**, so speakers never get mixed up
  mid-sentence.
- Colours are automatic and stable — the same friend is the same colour every
  stream, on every machine.
- You choose **exactly who gets captioned**, and can flip people in and out
  mid-call without reconnecting anything.
- The overlay background is transparent, so OBS just composites it over your
  scene.

### What you need

| | |
|---|---|
| **OS** | Windows, macOS (Intel or Apple Silicon), or Linux |
| **Disk** | ~350 MB for the app, plus the speech model you choose (40 MB–2.5 GB) |
| **RAM** | ~570 MB for a 7-person call on the recommended model |
| **A Discord bot** | Free, takes two minutes — [instructions below](#3-create-your-discord-bot) |
| **OBS** | Any recent version |

You do **not** need Node.js, a compiler, Visual Studio, Python, a paid speech
API, or an account with anyone.

---

## Set it up

About ten minutes, most of which is waiting for a download.

### 1. Install Chatterlayer

Grab the latest build from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/ruptz/Chatterlayer/releases). There's a normal
installer and a portable version if you'd rather not install anything.

> **Windows will warn you on first launch.** The builds aren't code-signed (that
> costs money we're not spending), so SmartScreen shows a blue box. Click
> *More info* → *Run anyway*.
>
> **On macOS** it's a bit worse — Gatekeeper may claim the app is "damaged". It
> isn't. Right-click the app → *Open*, or run
> `xattr -cr /Applications/Chatterlayer.app` in Terminal.

### 2. Pick a speech model

On first launch Chatterlayer asks which speech model to download. Models aren't
bundled with the app because they range from 40 MB to 2.5 GB and you only need
one.

There are nine, across four speech engines — all of them running entirely on your
own machine. **Pick Moonshine Base unless you have a reason not to**; it's the
default the app offers. The one reason you might: Vosk Medium puts words on screen
as they're spoken rather than a phrase at a time. See
[Which speech model should I pick?](#which-speech-model-should-i-pick) for the
details and the measured numbers.

### 3. Create your Discord bot

Chatterlayer needs a bot account to sit in your voice channel and listen. This is
free and takes about two minutes.

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   and click **New Application**. Name it whatever you like.
2. Open the **Bot** tab → **Add Bot**.
3. Click **Reset Token**, then **Copy**. This is what you paste into
   Chatterlayer. **Treat it like a password** — anyone who has it controls your
   bot.
4. **Leave all the Privileged Gateway Intents switched off.** Chatterlayer
   doesn't need them. If "Server Members" or "Message Content" are on, turn them
   off.
5. Open **OAuth2 → URL Generator** and tick:
   - **Scopes:** `bot`
   - **Bot Permissions:** `View Channel` and `Connect`
     *(it never talks, so it doesn't need `Speak`)*
6. Open the URL that generates, and invite the bot to your server.

> **Shortcut:** swap your own client ID into this URL and it does the same thing —
> `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=1049600&scope=bot`

### 4. Paste your token and pick a channel

Open Chatterlayer and paste your **bot token** into the **Source** panel. It
signs in, and the **Server** and **Voice channel** dropdowns fill with
everywhere your bot can go. Pick one and hit **Connect**.

There's no channel ID to copy and no Developer Mode to turn on. Chatterlayer
also checks permissions while it's listing, so:

- Channels your bot **can't join** are greyed out, with the missing permission
  named when you hover. That's the single most common setup mistake, caught
  before you waste 30 seconds on a failed connect.
- **Stage channels** are marked `stage`. A bot joining a stage lands in the
  *audience* and hears nothing at all until someone invites it to speak — worth
  knowing before you wonder why captions never appear.
- A channel at its user limit is marked `full`.

The **Channels** panel then fills with everyone currently in the call. Nobody is
captioned until you switch them on.

Your token is saved encrypted using your operating system's own keystore (DPAPI
on Windows, Keychain on macOS, libsecret on Linux), so you only paste it once —
after that Chatterlayer signs in by itself at launch and the dropdowns are ready
when you open it. Your bot therefore shows as **online in Discord whenever
Chatterlayer is open**, not only while you're captioning.

> If a channel doesn't show up — a brand-new one, say — hit **Refresh**. There's
> also an **Enter a channel ID manually** fallback under the picker if you ever
> need it.

### 5. Add the overlay to OBS

1. In OBS: **Sources → + → Browser**.
2. **URL:** copy it from Chatterlayer's **Output** panel — normally
   `http://127.0.0.1:8777/overlay`.
3. **Width / Height:** match your canvas, e.g. `1920` × `1080`.
4. Tick **Shutdown source when not visible** and **Refresh browser when scene
   becomes active**.
5. Drag it where you want it. Captions render in the bottom-left with a small
   margin, so leaving the source at full canvas size and positioning it at 0,0
   usually just works.

The overlay reconnects on its own, so you can add the source before Chatterlayer
is even running, and it survives you restarting the app mid-stream.

**Nothing is exposed to the internet.** The caption server only listens on
`127.0.0.1`, which means your own machine and nothing else.

---

## Which speech model should I pick?

Nine models across four engines. Everything runs **fully offline** — no API keys,
no cloud calls, whichever one you pick.

| Model | Download | RAM | Caption delay | Speakers | Punctuation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vosk Small | 40 MB | 170 MB + 12/speaker | live | 7 | — |
| Vosk Medium | 128 MB | 420 MB + 51/speaker | live | 7 | — |
| Vosk Large | 1.8 GB | ~5 GB | live | 4 | — |
| Vosk Gigaspeech | 2.3 GB | 6.8 GB | live | 3 | — |
| **Moonshine Base** ⭐ | **251 MB** | **550 MB** | **~150 ms** | **6** | **yes** |
| Whisper Tiny | 43 MB | 420 MB | ~650 ms | 2 | yes |
| Whisper Base | 79 MB | 700 MB | ~1 s | 1 | yes |
| Whisper Small | 251 MB | 1.8 GB | ~2.2 s | 1 | yes |
| Parakeet TDT 0.6B | 2.5 GB | 2.6 GB | ~290 ms | 4 | yes |

Measured on a Ryzen 5 5600X against real speech — reproduce with
`npm run bench -- --all --wav=yourfile.wav`. See
[Performance](#performance-and-limits) for the method and what the numbers mean.

**Two kinds of engine, and the difference matters.**

Vosk is a *streaming* recogniser: it updates the caption word by word as someone
talks, so text appears with essentially no delay. The trade is that it outputs a
lowercase stream of words with no punctuation, and each speaker needs their own
recogniser, so memory grows with the number of people.

Moonshine, Whisper and Parakeet transcribe a *phrase at a time*. They wait for
you to finish a thought, then produce a properly punctuated and capitalised
sentence. The caption arrives a fraction of a second later, but it reads like
writing rather than a transcript. One copy of the model serves everyone, so a
seventh speaker costs an audio buffer rather than another copy of the weights.

**Recommendations:**

- **Moonshine Base is the default, and the right answer for most people.** It
  beats Vosk Medium on every measured axis except immediacy: more accurate, adds
  punctuation and casing, produces a caption in ~150 ms, uses a tenth of the CPU
  per second of speech, and — because it loads one shared model — actually uses
  *less* memory than Vosk Medium once more than three people are on.
- **Vosk Medium** is the choice if you want text appearing as the words are
  spoken rather than at the end of each phrase. That immediacy is a real
  difference on stream, and it is the only thing it still wins on.
- **Parakeet TDT 0.6B** is the most accurate here and surprisingly quick, but
  wants 2.5 GB of download and ~2.6 GB of RAM.
- **The Whisper models are hard to recommend over Moonshine.** Every Whisper
  caption pays for a padded 30-second window whatever the phrase length, so Tiny
  is slower than its size suggests and Base takes about a second per caption
  while being less accurate than Moonshine. They are here because Whisper is
  what people ask for by name, and Small is genuinely accurate if you are
  captioning one person and don't mind waiting two seconds.

You can install several models and switch between them in the **Speech model**
dropdown without re-downloading anything. They live in your user data folder,
survive app updates, and **Remove** frees the disk space when you're done with
one. Switching engines needs a reconnect — the model is loaded once, at connect.

---

## On stream

### Choosing who gets captioned

The **Channels** panel lists everyone in the voice call with a toggle each.

Flip someone **on** and Chatterlayer starts transcribing them immediately. Flip
them **off** and it stops and frees the memory. You can do this live, mid-call,
as often as you like — nothing reconnects and nothing drops.

Nobody is captioned by default. That's deliberate; see
[Consent](#consent--read-this-one).

### Names and colours

**Click a name to change how it appears on captions.** Discord handles are rarely
what you want burned into your stream — `ruptz_45454` can show up as `Ruptz`. The
real handle stays visible underneath in the app so you can still tell who's who.
Clear the field to go back to their Discord name.

**Click the colour swatch** next to anyone to pick a different colour for them.

Both apply to the very next caption. No restart, no OBS refresh.

Colours are assigned automatically from each person's Discord ID, so the same
friend gets the same colour every time — and Chatterlayer guarantees **no two
people in the same call share a colour** (up to 16 people, which is where the
palette runs out).

### How the captions look

Everything in the **Output** panel applies to the live overlay instantly — no
OBS refresh needed:

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Text size** | 14–64 px |
| **Hold** | How long a caption stays on screen before fading (2–20 s) |
| **Max lines** | How many captions are visible at once (1–8) |
| **Live partial text** | Words appear as they're spoken, then get corrected when the sentence settles. Turn it off if you only want finished lines. |
| **Speaker names** | Show or hide the name in front of each caption |
| **Port** | Change it if `8777` clashes with something — remember to update the OBS URL |
| **Clear captions** | Wipes the overlay immediately. Handy panic button. |

### Watch it before your viewers do

The **Monitor** panel shows every caption as it goes out, in the same colours as
the overlay. Keep an eye on it — it's the fastest way to spot that someone's mic
is producing gibberish, or that the model is mishearing a name badly.

The **Log** panel underneath shows connection state and any errors. That's the
first place to look if something's not working.

---

## Sharing captions with your co-streamers

When four people in the same call are all live, you don't need four copies of
Chatterlayer. One person runs it; everyone else points OBS at a link.

That saves the others a bot, a speech model and the CPU to run it — and it means
every stream shows the *same* captions instead of four slightly different
transcriptions of the same conversation.

**This is off by default and never starts on its own.** Chatterlayer is offline
software and stays that way unless you deliberately do this, every time:

1. Open **Remote overlay** and tick *Let other streamers use these captions*.
   Nothing has opened yet — this only reveals the controls.
2. Press **Start tunnel**. The first time, Chatterlayer downloads
   [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared) (~35 MB, kept for
   next time). If you already have `cloudflared` on your PATH, that one is used.
3. Copy the link it gives you and send it to your co-streamers. They paste it
   into a **Browser** source in OBS, exactly like the local one.

Press **Stop tunnel**, or just close Chatterlayer, and the link dies. The tunnel
is always closed again the next time the app starts, however you left the tick
box.

### The access key

The link looks like this — the `?k=` part is an access key:

```
https://calm-river-quiet-1f4c.trycloudflare.com/overlay?k=Xk3pQ7rTvB2nL9wYzA4hMg
```

Without a valid key the page returns **401** and the caption feed refuses the
connection. A wrong key is refused exactly as firmly as no key — a truncated
one, one with characters appended, or the right value under a different
parameter name all get 401. Treat the link like a password: anyone you send it
to can watch your voice channel's captions for as long as the tunnel is up.

**One link, one session.** The key is generated fresh every time you press Start
and only ever exists in memory — it is never written to your config file. Stop
the tunnel, or close Chatterlayer, and it's gone for good. There is nothing to
clean up later and no old key sitting on disk; last week's link is dead twice
over, since the tunnel hostname was random too.

**New access key** mints a replacement mid-stream and immediately disconnects
anyone using the old link. That's the case it's for — cutting someone off while
you're still live. (It's only available while the tunnel is up; stopping already
throws the key away.)

Your own local OBS source is never affected by any of this:
`http://127.0.0.1:8777/overlay` keeps working with no key.

### What else guards the link

| | |
|---|---|
| **Key strength** | 128 bits from `crypto.randomBytes` — a CSPRNG, never `Math.random()` — as 22 URL-safe characters |
| **Comparison** | SHA-256 then `timingSafeEqual`, so a near-miss leaks nothing through timing |
| **Rate limiting** | 20 failed attempts per caller per minute, then `429` for a minute. A correct key resets the count. Keyed on Cloudflare's `cf-connecting-ip`, which the caller cannot forge |
| **Connection cap** | 16 simultaneous remote viewers. Your own OBS is never counted and never refused, so flooding the tunnel can't cost you your own overlay |
| **Transport** | The overlay refuses to open the caption feed if the page arrived over plain HTTP from anywhere but this machine, so the key is never put on the wire in clear text |
| **Read-only** | The caption feed is one-directional. The server registers no handler for inbound messages, and frames over 1 KB close the socket. A link grants watching, never controlling |
| **Logging** | The Log panel records the bare tunnel hostname, never the keyed link — safe to screenshot into a bug report |

Rate limiting is there to stop a scanner wasting your CPU mid-stream, not to
stop key guessing: at 128 bits, guessing was never the realistic attack.

### Each streamer can size it for their own scene

The host's sliders are the default for everyone, which is rarely what you want
when one person has a full-screen gameplay scene and another has a big face cam.
Anyone can override the styling for **their** browser source by adding
parameters to the end of their copy of the link:

| Add | Does |
|---|---|
| `&size=42` | Text size in px (8–200) |
| `&hold=5` | Seconds a caption stays up (0.5–120) |
| `&lines=2` | How many captions are visible at once (1–20) |
| `&partials=0` | Finished lines only — no live in-progress text |
| `&names=0` | Hide speaker names |

For example:

```
https://calm-river-quiet-1f4c.trycloudflare.com/overlay?k=Xk3pQ7rTvB2nL9wYzA4hMg&size=44&lines=2
```

These stick even when the host moves their own sliders mid-stream, and they
affect nobody else.

### What to know before you rely on it

- **The link changes every time you start the tunnel.** Quick Tunnels get a
  random hostname, so your co-streamers re-paste after you restart Chatterlayer.
  Sort it out before you go live, not during.
- **Cloudflare makes no uptime promise** for Quick Tunnels. They're free and
  need no Cloudflare account or domain, and that's the trade.
- **Audio still never leaves your machine.** What goes through the tunnel is the
  finished caption text — the same words already on your stream — and nothing
  else. Recognition is still entirely local.
- **Changing the port stops the tunnel**, since the old link would point at
  nothing. Start it again for a new one.

---

## Consent — read this one

Everyone in that call is being transcribed onto your stream, permanently, in
front of your audience.

**Tell them.** Use the per-person toggles to caption only the people who've
actually agreed. In some countries and US states, recording or transcribing
someone without their consent is illegal. Chatterlayer ships with everyone
switched **off** by default specifically so that the safe option is the default
one.

---

## The word filter

Captions hit your stream the instant they're recognised — there's no chance for
you to review them first. So **racial and ethnic slurs are masked by default**,
in both speech and speaker names:

```
he called me a *****        <- speech
*****                       <- a slur in someone's Discord name
```

The masking happens before captions reach OBS *or* the in-app Monitor, so the
unmasked text never leaves the app.

**Whole words only.** Substring matching would censor perfectly ordinary
speech — and a filter that mangles normal sentences is a filter you'll switch
off, which protects nobody. Plurals are handled automatically, and multi-word
slurs are caught across adjacent words.

**Adding your own.** The **Word filter** panel takes one word or phrase per line
and saves as you type. The built-in list covers racial and ethnic slurs only —
other categories vary a lot by platform and community, so those are yours to
set.

Words that are also ordinary words in common use are deliberately left out of the
defaults, because a false positive mid-sentence is worse than useless. Add them
yourself if your community needs them.

> **This is a safety net, not a guarantee.** Speech recognition mishears things.
> It can miss a slur by transcribing it as something else, and it can invent one
> nobody said. Treat the filter as one layer of protection, not as permission to
> leave captions running unattended.

---

## How good are the captions, really?

Honest expectations, because it's better to know now than to find out on stream.

Everything here runs offline on your own PC. That rules out the very best
cloud models, but it no longer means what it used to — Moonshine, Whisper and
Parakeet all land meaningfully closer to a paid service than Vosk does.

**What to expect:**

- **Vosk**: roughly **85–92%** of words correct for a clear speaker on a decent
  mic in a quiet room, as a lowercase stream with no punctuation.
- **Moonshine / Whisper / Parakeet**: better than that, with punctuation and
  capitalisation, and much better on proper nouns. Parakeet on clear speech gets
  close to what a paid service returns.
- Paid cloud services get 93–97% on the same audio, so there is still a gap at
  the top.
- Every engine degrades with background noise, music, strong accents, people
  talking over each other, and cheap microphones — the offline ones faster than
  the paid ones.
- Game jargon, usernames and memes are hard for all of them; the vocabulary is
  fixed and can't be nudged toward your community's slang.
- **Mic quality matters more than model size.** A friend on a bad headset will be
  the weak link no matter which model you run.

Here is the same eleven-second clip through every engine, so the difference is
concrete rather than adjectival (`npm run test:stt -- --all --wav=jfk.wav`):

```
Parakeet TDT 0.6B  And so, my fellow Americans. Ask not. What your country can do
                   for you. Ask what you can do for your country.
Whisper Small      And so, my fellow Americans, Ask not! What your country can do
                   for you, ask what you can do for your country.
Moonshine Base     And so my fellow Americans. Ask not. What your country can do
                   for you ask what you can do for your country
Whisper Base       and so my fellow Americans. Ask not! What your country can do
                   for you, ask what you can do for your country.
Whisper Tiny       And so am I fellow Americans. Ask, not! What your country can
                   do for you, ask what you can do for your country.
Vosk Medium        and so my fellow american ask not what your country can do for
                   you ask what you can do for your country
Vosk Small         and so my fellow americans as not what your country can do for
                   you ask what you can do for your country
```

Note where the small models slip: Whisper Tiny hears "am I" for "my", Vosk Small
hears "as not" for "ask not", and Vosk Medium drops the plural on "Americans".

**Why it's still the right call here:**

- **Free and unmetered.** Cloud speech-to-text runs about $0.02–0.06 per streamed
  hour *per person*. Seven people across a five-hour stream is real money, every
  single stream. Chatterlayer costs nothing to run, ever.
- **Private.** Your friends' voices never leave your machine. No provider terms
  to read, no data retention questions, no third party in the loop.
- **Nothing to break mid-stream.** No API key to expire, no quota to hit, no
  billing failure at 2am.
- **Fast**, because there's no round-trip to a server.
- **Works offline**, including when your connection wobbles.

**Want better accuracy?** Install **Parakeet TDT 0.6B** from the model picker. It
closes most of the gap on clear speech, and unlike the old advice here — which
pointed at Vosk Gigaspeech — it is not slow: a caption takes about 290 ms, and it
still manages four speakers. The cost is a 2.5 GB download and ~2.6 GB of RAM,
loaded once and shared however many people are on.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Model: NOT FOUND"**
Open the model picker (**Get models**) and download one.

---

**The Server dropdown is empty, or says "Sign-in failed"**
The sign-in line under the dropdown says which it is.

- *Sign-in failed* — the token is wrong, or you reset it in the Developer Portal
  and Chatterlayer still has the old one. Paste the current token and press
  **Refresh**.
- *Signed in, but no servers* — the bot isn't in a server yet, or the only ones
  it's in have no voice channels. Re-run the invite URL from step 3.

---

**The channel I want is greyed out**
The bot is missing **View Channel** or **Connect** on that specific channel —
hover it and the dropdown says which. Channel-level permission overrides beat
server-level ones, so fix it in that channel's own permission settings, not just
on the role. Press **Refresh** afterwards.

---

**Stuck on "Linking" and never connects**
Check the **Log** panel — it reports each stage (signing in → loading model →
looking up channel → joining voice), so you can see where it stopped. Usually
it's a big model still loading: Gigaspeech takes ~33 seconds on first connect,
and the log says which model it's on.

---

**Bot joins but no captions appear**

- Have you switched at least one person **on** in the Channels panel? Nobody is
  captioned by default.
- Is that person actually transmitting? Discord shows a green ring around their
  avatar when they are.
- Is it a **stage** channel? The bot sits in the audience and receives no audio
  until you invite it to speak.
- Check the **Log** panel — recogniser errors show up there.

---

**"Used disallowed intents"**
You turned on a privileged intent the bot doesn't need. Go back to the Discord
Developer Portal and switch **Server Members** and **Message Content** off.

---

**Port 8777 already in use**
Change the port in the **Output** panel — the server rebinds straight away. Then
update the URL in your OBS browser source to match.

---

**Overlay is blank in OBS**

- Check the URL matches the one shown in the **Output** panel (the port may have
  changed).
- Make sure Chatterlayer is actually running.
- Open the same URL in a normal browser: if the overlay can't reach the app,
  you'll see a "connecting" badge, which tells you it's a connection problem
  rather than an OBS problem.

---

**Captions fall further and further behind**
You're CPU-bound. Caption fewer people, or switch to a smaller model.

---

**Someone's audio dies mid-call, and the log mentions "Failed to decrypt"**
This is a Discord end-to-end-encryption quirk, not a Chatterlayer bug.
Chatterlayer already works around it and rebuilds broken audio streams
automatically (5 attempts). If someone's captions stop for good, toggle them off
and back on. Full explanation in the
[developer section](#the-dave-encryption-problem).

---

**Audio receive stops working after a Discord update**
Receiving voice as a bot isn't an officially supported part of Discord's API,
though the library Chatterlayer uses has supported it for years. If Discord
changes something, this can break until the library catches up. Worth knowing
before you build your whole stream layout around it.

---

## Support the project

Chatterlayer is free and always will be — no tiers, no upsell, no "pro" version
holding the good features hostage.

If it's earned you a coffee, there's a **Buy me a coffee** button in the bottom
corner of the app, or [ko-fi.com/ruptz](https://ko-fi.com/ruptz). Entirely
optional, and nothing in the app changes either way.

Bug reports and feature ideas are just as welcome — open an
[issue](https://github.com/ruptz/Chatterlayer/issues).

cd Chatterlayer
npm install
npm run setup     # the recommended model (Moonshine — needs no libvosk)
npm start
```

## Scripts

```bash
npm run setup -- --list                    # every model, grouped by engine
npm run setup -- --model=moonshine-base    # pick a specific one
npm run setup -- --model=whisper-base
npm run setup -- --runtime-only            # libvosk only (what CI uses)

npm run selftest                           # DSP, tokenisers, segmentation, wiring
npm run bench -- --all --wav=some.wav      # RAM, CPU and caption latency
npm run test:stt -- --all --wav=some.wav   # transcribe a WAV on every model
npm run test:vosk -- some.wav              # Vosk only, exercises the FFI binding
npm run engine:headless          # run the engine without Electron, for debugging
```

Config lives in `chatterlayer-config.json` in Electron's user-data folder
(**Show config file** in the UI reveals it). The bot token inside is encrypted
via `safeStorage`, backed by the OS keystore.

## How it works

```
Discord voice channel
   │  per-user Opus streams (48 kHz stereo)
   ▼
engine process (plain Node, forked)
   │  prism-media  → Opus decode
   │  resample.js  → 48 kHz stereo ➜ 16 kHz mono (25-tap FIR, −59 dB aliasing)
   ▼
stt-worker (worker thread)
   │  one shared model, whichever engine — Vosk streams and keeps a recognizer
   │  per speaker; the ONNX engines buffer each phrase and decode it once
   ▼
Electron main  ── adds each speaker's colour ──▶  WebSocket :8777
                                                   └─▶ /overlay  (OBS browser source)
```

**Why the engine is a child process.** Native/FFI modules load against plain Node
rather than Electron's ABI, a bot crash can't take the window down, and it can be
run headless (`npm run engine:headless`) for debugging.

**Why sign-in and join are separate.** The server/channel pickers are built from
`client.guilds.cache`, which only exists once the bot is logged in — so the app
signs in at launch (`signIn`) and joins a voice channel later (`start`). Two
consequences worth keeping intact:

- **Sign-in must not load a speech model.** It used to; with the
  pickers depending on login, that would mean staring at empty dropdowns for
  ~33 seconds on Gigaspeech. Signing in first also fails a bad token in about
  two seconds rather than after a full model load.
- **Disconnect calls `leave()`, not `stop()`.** `leave()` drops the voice
  connection and the recognizers but keeps the Discord session, because logging
  out would empty the pickers every time someone disconnected. Only app shutdown
  calls `stop()`.

`signIn` is idempotent and doubles as Refresh: called with the token already in
use it just re-emits the tree, and called with a different one it tears the old
session down first. The permission verdict per channel is deliberately
**tri-state** — `permissionsFor` returns `null` when the bot's own member isn't
cached, and rendering that as "can't join" would grey out channels that work.

**Why not the `vosk` npm package.** It binds libvosk through `ffi-napi`, which has
been unmaintained since 2022 and fails to compile on Node 18+ (`ffi-napi`'s
bundled libffi errors out during assembly preprocessing). Forcing it to build
would require every user to install Visual Studio Build Tools and Python, plus an
`electron-rebuild` pass. Chatterlayer instead binds the **same official libvosk**
through [koffi](https://koffi.dev/), which ships prebuilt N-API binaries — so the
same install works on both Node and Electron with no toolchain. See
`src/engine/vosk-binding.js`.

**Why persistent audio subscriptions.** Subscribing on each `speaking start` event
races the first voice packet and clips the first word of every utterance.
Chatterlayer holds a persistent subscription per selected speaker and uses
speaking events only to flush utterance boundaries. Discord sends no packets
during silence, so idle subscriptions are free.

## Speaker colours

Colours are hashed from the Discord user ID so the same person looks the same
across sessions and machines, with zero configuration. But hashing alone isn't
enough: with a 16-colour palette, **seven random users collide about 78% of the
time** (the birthday bound — measured, not theoretical), and two speakers sharing
a colour defeats the entire point.

So Chatterlayer assigns colours across the *whole call* at once. Each person
prefers their hashed colour; when two want the same one, the assignment probes
forward through the palette. Iterating in sorted ID order keeps it deterministic —
the same group always gets the same colours. Manual overrides are reserved first
and always win.

Result: **0% duplicate colours** for calls up to 16 people, while 81% of speakers
still keep their preferred colour. Past 16 concurrent speakers the palette is
exhausted and duplicates become unavoidable.

## The DAVE encryption problem

Symptom: `Failed to decrypt: DecryptionFailed(UnencryptedWhenPassthroughDisabled)`
in the log, and a speaker's audio dying mid-call.

This is Discord's DAVE end-to-end encryption. `@discordjs/voice` advertises E2EE
support by default, but E2EE only tolerates unencrypted frames during brief
(~10 s) "passthrough" windows around key changes. Once that window closes, an
unencrypted packet is rejected, and after enough consecutive failures the audio
stream throws and dies. The mismatch is easy to trigger, because Discord
downgrades a call out of E2EE when a participant that can't do it joins — which
is exactly what a bot is.

**Do not "fix" this by setting `daveEncryption: false`.** It looks like the obvious
answer and it's a trap: the flag is sent as `max_dave_protocol_version: 0` in the
voice IDENTIFY payload, and Discord then never completes the handshake. The bot
still *appears* in the voice channel — that part is the main gateway — but the
voice connection never receives `SESSION_DESCRIPTION`, never reaches `Ready`, and
the join times out after 30 s with "Could not join #channel within 30s".

Chatterlayer instead leaves DAVE enabled and raises `decryptionFailureTolerance`.
That works because of how `@discordjs/voice` consumes the result (`onUdpMessage`):
an undecryptable packet returns nothing and is **skipped harmlessly**, but once
the tolerance is exceeded it *throws*, and the throw calls `stream.destroy(error)`,
killing that speaker's audio for the rest of the call. With a high tolerance, bad
packets are simply dropped.

The log shows throttled `[voice] Failed to decrypt…` lines plus the DAVE
transition messages, which is what you need to diagnose it. A stream that does die
is rebuilt automatically (5 attempts, then it asks the user to toggle the speaker
off and on).

## Performance and limits

Measured on Windows 11, Node 22.13, Ryzen 5 5600X (6 cores / 12 threads), against
real speech. Reproduce with:

```bash
npm run bench -- --all --speakers=7 --wav=some-16k-mono.wav
```

Each model is measured in **its own child process**, because neither ONNX Runtime
nor libvosk returns memory to the OS when a model is released — measuring two in
one process reports the high-water mark of both.

### The whole table

| Model | Peak RAM | Load | CPU per second of speech | One caption | Speakers |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vosk Small | 170 MB + 12/speaker | 0.3 s | 0.095× continuous | live | 7 |
| Vosk Medium | 420 MB + 51/speaker | 0.8 s | 0.34× continuous | live | 7 |
| Moonshine Base | 507 MB | 1.3 s | 0.032× | 146–163 ms | 6–7 |
| Whisper Tiny | 413 MB | 0.5 s | 0.090× | 601–667 ms | 2 |
| Whisper Base | 695 MB | 0.7 s | 0.129× | 945–1112 ms | 1 |
| Whisper Small | 1822 MB | 1.3 s | 0.280× | ~2225 ms | 1 |
| Parakeet TDT 0.6B | 2568 MB | 2.8 s | 0.062× | ~290 ms | 4 |

The three models near the decision boundary were run three times each, because a
single run moved the suggested speaker count by one. Whisper Tiny came out at 2
every time and Whisper Base at 1 every time, which is what the catalogue now says.

Vosk Large and Gigaspeech are not in this run (1.8 GB and 2.3 GB downloads); their
catalogue figures are extrapolated from model size.

### Memory when several people are captioned at once

**No engine here loads the model more than once.** This is the single most
important thing to know about running many speakers, and it is worth stating
plainly because the arithmetic people expect does not apply: Parakeet is **not**
2.5 GB per speaker. It is 2.5 GB, once, shared by everyone.

What each additional speaker actually costs:

| Engine | Per additional speaker | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Vosk | 12–51 MB | Its own recogniser and decoding lattice |
| Moonshine / Whisper / Parakeet | ~3 MB | An audio buffer, and nothing else |

So on the ONNX engines memory is essentially flat in the number of speakers —
seven people on Moonshine Base is about 570 MB, not 3.8 GB. Vosk is the one where
memory grows, and how fast depends on the model: Medium's decoding lattice is
51 MB per speaker against Small's 12 MB.

Two measured caveats:

- **Whisper's memory is mostly not its weights.** Whisper Small is a 380 MB model
  that peaks at 1.8 GB, because its encoder input is a fixed 30-second window and
  the activations are large. Chatterlayer therefore runs the Whisper sessions
  with ONNX Runtime's memory arena **disabled** — with it on, Whisper Small peaks
  at 3.6 GB instead, in exchange for about a third off the decode time. Set
  `CHATTERLAYER_STT_ARENA=1` to take that trade the other way. Moonshine and
  Parakeet keep the arena, where it costs 100 MB and 400 MB respectively.
- **Vosk Medium's per-speaker cost is 51 MB, not the 12 MB earlier versions of
  this README claimed.** The old figure came from benchmarking against synthetic
  noise, which keeps the decoding lattice far smaller than real speech does.

### CPU, and where the speaker limits come from

The two engine families run out of CPU in completely different ways.

**Vosk draws continuously.** It does a fixed amount of work per 20 ms of audio,
so cost is `0.34× of a core per talking speaker` on Medium. Seven people all
talking at once is ~2.4 cores. That peak is rare — Discord transmits no packets
while someone is silent, so idle speakers cost nothing.

**The others draw in bursts.** They do no work at all until a phrase ends, then
spend one decode on it. Cost per second of *speech* is far lower than Vosk's
(0.032× for Moonshine), and silence is trimmed before decoding, so a quiet channel
is nearly free.

What limits them instead is **latency**, because decodes are queued one at a time.
If four people stop talking at the same instant, the fourth caption waits for
three decodes ahead of it. The speaker limits in the table are the point where
that worst case stays under 1.5 seconds:

```
Moonshine Base, 4-second utterances, worst case all finishing together:
   1 speaker    96 ms      5 speakers   464 ms
   2 speakers  187 ms      6 speakers   568 ms
   3 speakers  284 ms      7 speakers   750 ms
```

Everyone finishing simultaneously is the worst case, not the common one — in real
conversation people mostly take turns, so the practical ceiling is higher than the
table says. Runs also vary by about one speaker either way. The app **warns rather
than refuses** when you go over: the model note turns amber and the log says so.

Decodes are deliberately **serialised** rather than run in parallel. Seven
simultaneous decodes would contend for the same cores and every one of them would
miss its deadline; one at a time, the first six are early and only the last is
late. Within that, **finals always run and partials are dropped** whenever a real
decode is waiting — a speculative in-progress guess is never allowed to delay a
finished sentence.

Tuning knobs, all environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `CHATTERLAYER_STT_THREADS` | half the cores, max 8 | Threads per decode |
| `CHATTERLAYER_STT_CONCURRENCY` | 1 | Decodes allowed at once |
| `CHATTERLAYER_STT_PARTIALS` | on | `0` disables in-progress guesses |
| `CHATTERLAYER_STT_ARENA` | per engine | `0`/`1` overrides the memory arena |
| `CHATTERLAYER_STT_MAX_UTTERANCE` | 20 | Seconds before a turn is force-closed |

### Memory (Vosk, in detail)

The acoustic model is loaded **once** and shared by every recognizer, so adding a
speaker costs only a recognizer — not another copy of the model.

| Selected speakers | Engine process RSS |
|---|---|
| model only (0 speakers) | 152 MB |
| 1 | 168 MB |
| 2 | 181 MB |
| 3 | 192 MB |
| 4 | 204 MB |
| 5 | 216 MB |
| 6 | 228 MB |
| 7 | **240 MB** |

- **Shared model:** ~116 MB, paid once.
- **Per additional speaker:** **~12 MB** (the first is ~16 MB).
- **Plus the Electron UI:** roughly 100–180 MB depending on platform.
- **Realistic total for a 7-person call:** **~400–450 MB**.

Switching a speaker off frees their recognizer immediately.

**The model choice dominates everything else.** Per-speaker cost barely moves
between models — it's the shared model that changes:

| Model | Model RAM | Per speaker | 4 speakers total |
|---|---|---|---|
| `small-en-us-0.15` | 116 MB | ~12 MB | **204 MB** |
| `en-us-0.42-gigaspeech` | 6842 MB | ~15 MB | **6939 MB** |

So adding speakers is cheap; adding accuracy is not.

### CPU

The benchmark reports ~0.025× realtime per stream, but **that number is
optimistic** — it uses synthetic noise, which Vosk's silence detection prunes far
more aggressively than real speech. For planning, budget **0.1–0.3× of one core
per actively-talking speaker** on a modern desktop CPU. Seven people all talking
at once is therefore roughly **1–2 cores**, and that peak is rare: Discord
transmits no packets while someone is silent, so idle speakers cost essentially
nothing.

Decoding runs on a **dedicated worker thread**, deliberately: blocking the main
thread would stall the Discord voice socket and drop inbound audio packets.

### Latency

End-to-end, speech → pixels on stream:

**Vosk** (streaming — text appears as the words are said):

| Stage | Typical |
|---|---|
| Discord network + 20 ms Opus framing | ~60–100 ms |
| Resample + queue to worker | <5 ms |
| Partial decode + 120 ms update throttle | ~120–250 ms |
| Local WebSocket + browser paint | <20 ms |
| **Live partial text appears** | **~250–500 ms** |
| **Finalised line** (after the speaker pauses) | **~0.5–1.5 s** |

**Moonshine / Whisper / Parakeet** (a phrase at a time):

| Stage | Typical |
|---|---|
| Discord network + 20 ms Opus framing | ~60–100 ms |
| Waiting for the phrase to end | Discord's `speaking end`, or 800 ms of silence |
| One decode | 120 ms (Moonshine) → 2.2 s (Whisper Small) |
| Local WebSocket + browser paint | <20 ms |
| **Finalised line** | **~0.3 s (Moonshine) → ~3 s (Whisper Small)** |

The wait for the phrase to end is usually shorter than 800 ms, because Discord's
own `speaking end` event arrives first and closes the utterance immediately. The
800 ms silence detector is the fallback for someone talking straight through.

These engines can also produce in-progress guesses by re-running on the audio so
far, and do when there is CPU to spare — but they are speculative: at most one
outstanding per speaker, skipped whenever a real decode is waiting, and discarded
if the phrase has already ended. On a busy channel they mostly stop happening,
which is the intended behaviour.

### Adding another engine

Four engines share one interface, and everything above `src/engine/stt/` deals in
`{ userId, text, isFinal }` without knowing which produced it. A fifth needs:

1. A module in `src/engine/stt/` exporting `static streaming` and
   `static load(dir)`. Streaming engines expose `createSession()`; the rest expose
   `transcribe(Float32Array) → Promise<string>` and get utterance buffering,
   silence detection and decode scheduling for free.
2. An entry in `LOADERS` and `ENGINES` in `src/engine/stt/index.js`.
3. A catalogue entry in `src/shared/models.js`.

Nothing else changes — not the worker, not the Discord side, not the caption
server, not the overlay. The picker, the downloader and the manifest on disk all
come from the catalogue entry.

## Shipping a release

**You don't build releases on your own machine — CI does.** Cutting a release is
two commands:

```bash
# 1. bump "version" in package.json, commit it
# 2. tag and push
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin v1.0.1
```

That triggers `release.yml`, which builds all three platforms in parallel and
opens a **draft** GitHub Release with everything attached. Review it, then hit
publish.

### How users find out

The running version is stamped in the top-right of the control panel. Once a
day Chatterlayer asks GitHub whether a newer release exists; if there is one,
the stamp lights amber and opens the release page when clicked.

Nothing is downloaded and nothing self-installs — see the comment at the top of
`src/main/updates.js` for why. The short version: the binaries are unsigned,
which rules out macOS auto-update entirely, and neither the portable `.exe` nor
the `.deb` can replace themselves. A link works for every build we ship.

Two things worth knowing:

- **Drafts are invisible to it.** The check reads GitHub's *latest published
  release*, which excludes drafts and prereleases. Nobody is notified until you
  actually hit publish on the draft the workflow opened.
- **It's the only request Chatterlayer makes on its own** — everything else is
  Discord and localhost. It's a visible setting for that reason: **Output →
  Check for updates**, on by default. Switched off, no request is made at all.

### Why not build all three locally?

Because you can't. Each installer must be built on its own OS:

| Target | Buildable on Windows? |
|---|---|
| Windows `.exe` | Yes — `npm run dist:win` |
| macOS `.dmg` | **No.** Requires macOS (code signing and `hdiutil`) |
| Linux `.AppImage` / `.deb` | Not practically — needs Linux or Docker |

The release workflow sidesteps this with a build matrix: `windows-latest`,
`macos-latest` and `ubuntu-latest` each build their own target natively. That's
the main reason to release through CI rather than by hand.

### What gets published

| Platform | Artifacts |
|---|---|
| Windows | `Chatterlayer-<version>-Setup.exe` (installer), `Chatterlayer-<version>-portable.exe` |
| macOS | `Chatterlayer-<version>.dmg` (x64 + arm64) |
| Linux | `Chatterlayer-<version>.AppImage`, `.deb` |

Roughly 90–140 MB per file. Speech models are **not** included — the app downloads
the one the user picks on first run.

### Code signing

The builds are **unsigned**, which is fine but has consequences worth knowing
before you announce anything:

- **Windows** — SmartScreen warns on first launch (*More info* → *Run anyway*).
  Annoying, but users get through it. To sign, add `CSC_LINK` and
  `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` as repository secrets; `release.yml` already passes them
  through.
- **macOS** — considerably worse. Gatekeeper refuses to open unsigned apps and
  often claims the app is "damaged". Users must right-click → *Open*, or run
  `xattr -cr /Applications/Chatterlayer.app`. Fixing this properly needs an Apple
  Developer account ($99/yr) plus notarisation. The release notes explain the
  workaround.
- **Linux** — no signing expectations; users just `chmod +x` the AppImage.

### Local builds

```bash
npm run icon                       # regenerate build/icon.png from the logo
npm run setup -- --runtime-only    # fetch libvosk (required before packaging)
npm run pack                       # unpacked build — fast, for testing
npm run dist:win                   # real installer + portable exe
```

### What ships, and what doesn't

**Bundled:** the `libvosk` runtime, for the Vosk models. It's platform-specific so
it must be chosen at build time, and it lives outside the asar archive because
`koffi.load()` needs a real file on disk. The macOS build ships a universal
(x86_64 + arm64) library, so Apple Silicon runs natively.

**Also bundled:** ONNX Runtime, for Moonshine, Whisper and Parakeet. It arrives as
an ordinary npm dependency with prebuilt N-API binaries, so — like koffi — it needs
no compiler on the user's machine and no `electron-rebuild` pass. Two things about
it are load-bearing in `electron-builder.yml`:

- The whole `onnxruntime-node` directory is in `asarUnpack`, not just `**/*.node`.
  The binding pulls in `onnxruntime.dll` as an ordinary shared-library dependency,
  so the OS loader has to find it as a real file beside the binding.
- `npm install` fetches 246 MB: a library for all six platform/arch combinations
  plus a DirectML provider. Chatterlayer asks for the CPU provider only, so the
  per-platform `files` filters drop the architectures not being built and the GPU
  libraries — about 200 MB and 38 MB respectively on a Windows build. CI asserts
  both, because the failure mode is silent.

**Not bundled:** speech models. They're 40 MB–2.5 GB, each user needs exactly one,
and the app downloads the chosen model into the user's data directory on first
run — which also keeps them out of Program Files, where the app has no write
access.

CI must therefore run `npm run setup -- --runtime-only` before packaging.
