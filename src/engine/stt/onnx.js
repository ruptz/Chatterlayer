 * Whether to let ONNX Runtime keep its CPU memory arena.
 *
 * The arena reuses one big pool across runs instead of allocating per run. It is
 * a straight speed-for-memory trade, and how good a trade depends entirely on how
 * large the graph's activations are — which is why engines choose rather than
 * inheriting one global answer. Measured on a Ryzen 5 5600X, 4-second utterance:
 *
 *   Whisper Small   arena 3609 MB / 1600 ms      no arena 1779 MB / 2278 ms
 *   Whisper Base    arena 1899 MB /  536 ms      no arena 1075 MB /  713 ms
 *   Whisper Tiny    arena  833 MB /  298 ms      no arena  382 MB /  423 ms
 *
 * Whisper pays so much because its encoder input is a fixed 30-second window
 * whatever the utterance length, so the activations are large and identical every
 * time. Moonshine's arena costs ~100 MB and Parakeet's ~400 MB, so for those the
 * memory is worth the speed and they keep it.
 *
 * CHATTERLAYER_STT_ARENA=1 or 0 overrides the engine's choice either way.
