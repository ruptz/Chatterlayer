/**
 * Turns a continuous stream of audio into utterances, for the engines that need
 * whole utterances.
 *
 * Vosk decides for itself where an utterance ends — it is a streaming recogniser
 * and reports that boundary as part of its output. Whisper, Moonshine and
 * Parakeet do not: they transcribe a clip and stop. Something has to decide what
 * a clip is, and that decision is what this class holds.
 *
 * Two things end an utterance in practice. Discord's own `speaking end` event is
 * the reliable one and arrives as an explicit flush. Trailing silence is the
 * other, and matters because someone who talks for a minute straight would
 * otherwise be one enormous clip that no model can transcribe in one pass.
 *
 * The speech/silence test is deliberately cheap — frame energy against a slowly
 * tracked noise floor. It is not trying to be a VAD model; it is trying to know
 * whether there is anything worth spending a decode on. That last part matters
 * more than it sounds: Whisper in particular hallucinates confidently on silence
 * (a stray "Thank you." is the classic), so an utterance that never contained
 * speech must be thrown away rather than transcribed.
